# swapi-planets

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3.

You can view the project live at [swapi-planets.vercel.app](https://swapi-planets.vercel.app/). This project was created as part of a recruiting process and demonstrates the use of various technologies and tools.

## Tech Stack

- **SCSS with BEM**: For styling the application using a modular and maintainable approach.
- **Storybook**: To develop and test UI components in isolation.
- **Pinia**: For state management, offering a simple and intuitive API.
- **Vue 3 Composition API**: To structure and manage component logic efficiently.
- **SWAPI (Star Wars API)**: Used to fetch data about planets from the Star Wars universe.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.
